# Intelligent-Currency-Recognition-System

Business Value: Built currency identification and validation system which aimed at automating global currency exchange and banking transactions.   

# Project Overview

1) Collected more than 2500 diverse real world currency images representing 6 different countries, augmented currency images to make the dataset more generalized.
2) Built Convolutional Neural Network and hyper tuned the Deep Learning Model which resulted into 93.8% accuracy. 
3) Used the same dataset and built the classification model using Ensemble Learning technique which combined Random forest algorithm and Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier algorithm resulting into 81% accuracy. 
4) Fine-tuned classification model and implemented K Fold Cross validation in order to make model more accurate, flexible and robust. 

# Technologies Used

1) OpenCV, Scikit-image, Numpy, Pandas, Image-Generator for data pre-processing
2) Scikit learn, Matplotlib for data modelling and data visualization
3) Keras 2.0 and Tensorflow for building deep learning model, Tensor board for tracking modelâ€™s performance. 
4) Python Flask for deploying model as a web service.  

# Future Scope

1) Dive deep into the denominations and try identifying fake currency images. 
2) Involve more currencies and develop a real time dynamic currency conversion web application.
